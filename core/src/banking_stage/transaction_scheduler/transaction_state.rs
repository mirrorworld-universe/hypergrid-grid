/// TransactionState is used to track the state of a transaction in the transaction scheduler

///
/// There are two states a transaction can be in:
///     1. `Unprocessed` - The transaction is available for scheduling.
///     2. `Pending` - The transaction is currently scheduled or being processed.
///
/// Newly received transactions are initially in the `Unprocessed` state.
/// When a transaction is scheduled, it is transitioned to the `Pending` state,
///   using the `transition_to_pending` method.
/// When a transaction finishes processing it may be retryable. If it is retryable,
///   the transaction is transitioned back to the `Unprocessed` state using the
///   `transition_to_unprocessed` method. If it is not retryable, the state should
///   be dropped.
///
/// For performance, when a transaction is transitioned to the `Pending` state, the
///   internal `SanitizedTransaction` is moved out of the `TransactionState` and sent
///   to the appropriate thread for processing. This is done to avoid cloning the
///  `SanitizedTransaction`.
